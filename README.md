# About the contest

This is the source code for the contest infrastructure for junit testing tools.
The contest was initiated during the FITTEST European project no. 257574 (2010-2013)
and hence partly funded by the FP7 programme on ICT Software & Service Architectures and Infrastructures.

The [FITTEST](http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fittest/) project, which developed an integrated environment for the automated and continuous testing of Future Internet Applications, was coordinated by:

  Tanja E. J. Vos (tvos@pros.upv.es)
  Software Quality & Testing
  Research Center on Software Production Methods ([PROS](http://www.pros.webs.upv.es/))
  Department of Information Systems and Computation ([DSIC](http://www.upv.es/entidades/DSIC/index.html))
  Universitat Politècnica de València ([UPV](http://www.upv.es/))
  Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia (Spain)

The contest infrastructure has been used in testing contests during yearly events since 2013 (check the [Acknowledgements](docs/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) and [Publications](docs/PUBLICATIONS.md)).
